# Challenge-1

## Description

In this project we were to utilize what we've learned during the first week of the coding bootcamp to improve the accessibility of a website and to refactor the code. The website was made more accessible by adding semantic HTML and img tags to images and some of the CSS code was consolidated to create cleaner code for future use.
